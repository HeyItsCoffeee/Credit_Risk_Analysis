# Credit_Risk_Analysis

## Purpose

The purpose of this analysis is to develop machine learning models that can predict credit risk using the credit card credit dataset from LendingClub. Credit risk is an inherently unbalanced classification problem, as good loans easily outnumber risky loans. Therefore, different techniques are employed to train and evaluate models with unbalanced classes.
